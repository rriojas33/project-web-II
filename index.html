                        The legend of Santa Claus can be traced back hundreds of years to a monk named St. Nicholas.
                         It is believed that Nicholas was born sometime around 280 A.D. in Patara, near Myra in modern-day Turkey.
                         Much admired for his piety and kindness, St. Nicholas became the subject of many legends</p>

                    <p>Christmas ornaments have had a long history. The tradition of decorating an
                         evergreen tree during the holidays goes all the way back to 16th century Germany.
                         These trees represented the forbidden fruit from Genesis in the Bible.
                         Ornaments were later made of glass and sometimes apple-shaped or round.</p>

        <p>The evergreen fir tree has traditionally been used to celebrate winter festivals (pagan and Christian) 
        for thousands of years. Pagans used branches of it to decorate their homes during the winter solstice, as it made them think of the spring to come. The Romans used Fir Trees to decorate their temples at the festival of Saturnalia.
         Christians use it as a sign of everlasting life with God.
